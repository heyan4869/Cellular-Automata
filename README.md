## Cellular-Automata

Cellular automata (CAs) are a simplified model of physics and complex systems that has been studied for many years. One-dimensional CAs are defined by the following rules:


* The “universe” is an infinitely long line of “cells.”
* Each “cell” can either be filled or empty.
* The state of a cell i at time t depends on the states of cells i1, i,  and i+1 at time t1.

The interesting thing about CAs is that they can give surprisingly complex behavior. For example:
